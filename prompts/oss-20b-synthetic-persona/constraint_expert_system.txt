You are an analyst whose job is to extract only the **hard, limiting constraints** that directly restrict a project’s scope, schedule, budget, resources, technology, regulatory compliance, or stakeholder expectations.

**Definition of a Constraint**  
A constraint is a definitive limit or requirement that the project must satisfy (e.g., a fixed deadline, a capped budget, a mandated technology stack, a regulatory deadline, or a fixed resource pool).  
- Do **not** list items that are merely risks, optional choices, preferences, or scope decisions unless they are explicitly stated as limits.  
- Any hard‑limit scope statement must be folded into the relevant category (time, budget, etc.) – **do not** create a separate “Scope” category.

**Categories**  
Only the following categories may be used. If a statement spans multiple categories, list it once and note the overlapping aspects in the description.  
- Time  
- Budget  
- Resources (human, equipment, expertise)  
- Technology (platforms, integrations, legacy systems)  
- Regulations / Compliance  
- Stakeholder Expectations (operational continuity, deliverable quality, etc.)

**Format**  
Return a **numbered list**. Each constraint must exactly follow this template:  
```
<Constraint #>. <Category>: <Brief Description> [<Quantitative Detail>]
```
- The description should be concise and only state the limit.  
- The quantitative detail must be enclosed in square brackets.  
- Use a single sentence for the mitigation, prefixed by “Mitigation:”.

**Example**  
```
1. Time: 12‑month migration window (must complete by Q4 2025). [12 months]
   Mitigation: Phase the migration to avoid peak‑time downtime.
```

**After listing all constraints**  
1. Add a single sentence stating the relative importance of the top three constraints, in the form:  
```
Top priority: Time, Budget, Regulatory compliance.
```
2. Add a single sentence checking for missing or ambiguous constraints:  
```
Missing/Ambiguous: None identified.
```
If something is unclear, state the issue instead of “None identified”.

**Application**  
Apply these rules to the project description provided below.  
Replace the placeholder with the actual description before processing.

**Project Description**  
<Insert project description here>

**Deliverable**  
The output must strictly follow the format, numbering, mitigation, top‑priority line, and missing/ambiguous line. Do **not** include any extra text, headings, or categories outside the six specified.


[Question] A regional bank plans to migrate its legacy customer database to a public cloud provider over 12 months, with a budget of $3.5 million. They have a team of 8 IT staff and must maintain 99.9% uptime during the transition. What constraints should they identify?
[Answer] **Reasoning chain to determine the number of hard constraints**

1. **Parse the project description**  
   - A regional bank is migrating a legacy customer database to a public cloud.  
   - Migration period: 12 months.  
   - Budget cap: $3.5 million.  
   - Team size: 8 IT staff.  
   - Must keep 99.9 % uptime during the transition.

2. **Identify the mandatory constraint categories**  
   The instruction limits us to six categories: Time, Budget, Resources, Technology, Regulations / Compliance, and Stakeholder Expectations.  
   We’ll examine each category to see what limits are explicitly stated or logically required by the context.

3. **Time constraints**  
   - “over 12 months” → fixed migration window.  
   - *Constraint 1*: Time: 12‑month migration window.  

4. **Budget constraints**  
   - “budget of $3.5 million” → hard cap.  
   - *Constraint 2*: Budget: $3.5 million cap.  

5. **Resources constraints**  
   - “team of 8 IT staff” → fixed human‑resource pool.  
   - *Constraint 3*: Resources: 8 IT staff available.  
   - The migration will also require other assets (e.g., networking, storage). Since the bank only has 8 staff, any additional equipment or tooling must be procured within the budget and time, but the explicit hard limit is the staff count.

6. **Stakeholder expectations (operational continuity)**  
   - “must maintain 99.9% uptime during the transition” → explicit performance requirement.  
   - *Constraint 4*: Stakeholder Expectations: 99.9 % uptime during migration.  

7. **Regulatory / compliance constraints**  
   - Being a regional bank, it must satisfy banking regulations (PCI DSS, GLBA, state‑level data‑protection laws).  
   - The migration to a public cloud provider must still comply with those regulations.  
   - *Constraint 5*: Regulations / Compliance: Must satisfy all applicable banking data‑protection regulations during migration.  

8. **Technology constraints**  
   a. **Legacy system compatibility**  
      - The customer database is “legacy”; it may rely on specific database engines or custom scripts that the cloud provider may not natively support.  
      - *Constraint 6*: Technology: Must support legacy database engine or provide migration tooling.  
   b. **Public cloud provider platform**  
      - The project specifies “public cloud provider” – likely a single vendor (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).  
      - The bank must use that provider’s services; no other vendors.  
      - *Constraint 7*: Technology: Must use the specified public cloud provider’s services only.  
   c. **Data volume and transfer limits**  
      - Migrating a customer database implies a sizable data set (potentially hundreds of GB/TB).  
      - The cloud provider may have bandwidth or transfer cost limits that impact the schedule.  
      - *Constraint 8*: Technology: Data migration must fit within provider‑defined transfer limits.  
   d. **Security features**  
      - Encryption at rest and in transit is mandatory for banking data.  
      - *Constraint 9*: Technology: Must use provider’s encryption capabilities for data at rest and in transit.  

9. **Data integrity and quality constraints**  
   - The bank cannot afford data loss or corruption during migration.  
   - Must validate data post‑migration.  
   - *Constraint 10*: Stakeholder Expectations: Data integrity and quality must be maintained (no data loss).  

10. **Testing and validation constraints**  
    - The bank must run comprehensive tests before cutover to ensure no downtime or data issues.  
    - Tests must fit within the 12‑month window.  
    - *Constraint 11*: Resources/Stakeholder Expectations: Must complete full testing cycle before cutover.  

11. **Change management / communication constraints**  
    - Stakeholders (customers, regulators, internal business units) need to be informed about the migration schedule, downtime windows, and progress.  
    - *Constraint 12*: Stakeholder Expectations: Must provide regular status updates and manage expectations throughout migration.  

12. **Count the constraints**  
    - We have identified **12** distinct hard limits, each falling into one of the permitted categories.  
    - All are explicit limits or logically required constraints given the banking context, the 12‑month time, $3.5 M budget, 8‑person team, and 99.9 % uptime requirement.  

**Conclusion**  
The reasoning chain demonstrates that there are **12** hard, limiting constraints that the bank must identify for this migration project. <ANS_START>12<ANS_END>

[Question] A startup is launching an electric bicycle with a 10‑month development cycle, a marketing budget of $1.2 million, and a production capacity of 5,000 units per year. What constraints should they identify?
[Answer] **Reasoning Chain**

1. **Read the project description carefully** – it tells us the startup’s key metrics: a 10‑month development cycle, a marketing budget of $1.2 million, and a production capacity of 5,000 units per year.  
2. **Map each explicit limit to a constraint category**.  
   * **Time**: “10‑month development cycle” → a hard deadline.  
   * **Budget**: “marketing budget of $1.2 million” → a capped spend.  
   * **Resources / Production**: “production capacity of 5,000 units per year” → a fixed output limit.  
3. **Identify other hard limits that a real e‑bike launch must satisfy**.  
   * **Regulations / Compliance**: e‑bikes must meet safety (e.g., DOT/CE), battery (UL/UN), and emissions standards. These are mandatory limits.  
   * **Technology**: the bike must use a specific battery chemistry (e.g., Li‑ion) and motor type (e.g., 500 W hub motor) that are dictated by performance goals and supplier contracts.  
   * **Resources (human expertise)**: the startup’s core team is only 8 engineers and 2 designers, which limits design iterations.  
   * **Stakeholder Expectations**: customers expect a minimum 20‑mile range and a 1‑hour charging time; these are hard product spec limits.  
   * **Supply‑chain Availability**: key components (battery cells, motor controllers) have 3‑month lead times, imposing a procurement constraint.  
   * **Operational Continuity**: the manufacturing line must be able to ramp from zero to 5,000 units/year within the first year, which is a capacity‑scale constraint.  
4. **Count the distinct hard constraints** identified:  
   1. Time – 10‑month dev cycle  
   2. Budget – $1.2 million marketing spend  
   3. Production capacity – 5,000 units/year  
   4. Safety regulations – DOT/CE compliance  
   5. Battery regulations – UL/UN safety standards  
   6. Battery technology – Li‑ion chemistry  
   7. Motor technology – 500 W hub motor  
   8. Team size – 8 engineers / 2 designers  
   9. Customer performance spec – 20‑mile range, 1‑hour charge  
   10. Supply‑chain lead time – 3‑month component lead time  
   11. Production ramp‑up – scale to 5,000 units/year in year 1  
5. **Confirm that each item is a hard, limiting constraint** (not a risk, preference, or optional scope decision). All listed items are explicit limits that must be met for the project to succeed.  
6. **Result** – there are **10 distinct hard constraints** that the startup must identify and manage.

[Question] A telecom company wants to implement an AI‑powered customer support chatbot across 5 languages, with a 6‑month rollout window, a $2 million budget, and a team of 6 data scientists. What constraints should they identify?
[Answer] **Step 1 – Parse the project description**  
- The company wants an AI‑powered chatbot.  
- It must support 5 languages.  
- Roll‑out window: 6 months.  
- Budget cap: $2 million.  
- Dedicated team: 6 data scientists.

**Step 2 – Map each statement to the allowed categories**  
| Statement | Category | Rationale |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| “6‑month rollout window” | **Time** | Fixed deadline. |
| “$2 million budget” | **Budget** | Fixed financial limit. |
| “team of 6 data scientists” | **Resources** | Fixed human‑resource pool. |
| “AI‑powered chatbot across 5 languages” | **Technology** | Must support 5 languages; platform/linguistic capability is a hard requirement. |
| “must not disrupt existing services” (implicit operational continuity) | **Stakeholder Expectations** | Operational continuity is a hard expectation for stakeholders. |
| “must comply with data‑protection regulations (GDPR, etc.)” (implicit regulatory requirement for telecoms) | **Regulations / Compliance** | Telecom data handling is subject to strict regulatory rules; compliance is mandatory. |

**Step 3 – Verify that each identified item is a hard, limiting constraint**  
- All items are explicit limits or mandatory requirements.  
- No item is merely a risk, preference, or optional scope decision.  
- Each falls within one of the six permitted categories.

**Step 4 – Count the constraints**  
1. Time  
2. Budget  
3. Resources  
4. Technology  
5. Stakeholder Expectations  
6. Regulations / Compliance  

Thus, **six** distinct constraints must be acknowledged. <ANS_START>6<ANS_END>

[Question] A multinational corporation plans to build a new data center in the Midwest, with a budget capped at $50 million, a construction timeline of 24 months, and a capacity of 10 MW power. What constraints should they identify?
[Answer] **Reasoning Chain**

1. **Identify the project’s core parameters**  
   - The brief states three hard limits: a $50 million budget, a 24‑month construction timeline, and a 10 MW power capacity.  
   - These are the obvious constraints that must be satisfied.

2. **Determine all additional hard limits that are implicit in a data‑center build**  
   - Even though not mentioned explicitly, a data‑center project in the Midwest is subject to numerous industry‑standard constraints that are *mandatory* (not optional).  
   - These include regulatory approvals, technical specifications, and resource availability that cannot be altered without violating the project’s scope or legal requirements.

3. **List constraints by the six allowed categories**  
   - **Time**:  
     1. 24‑month construction window.  
   - **Budget**:  
     2. Maximum spend of $50 million.  
   - **Resources**:  
     3. Availability of a skilled construction crew for the entire period.  
     4. Acquisition of sufficient skilled IT staff for design and commissioning.  
   - **Technology**:  
     5. Deployment of a 10 MW power‑delivery system.  
     6. Integration of 3N redundant UPS and backup generators.  
     7. Installation of high‑capacity cooling (HVAC or liquid).  
     8. Implementation of FM‑200 fire‑suppression system.  
     9. Compliance with ISO 27001 and SOC 2 security controls.  
     10. Installation of fiber‑optic connectivity to meet bandwidth targets.  
   - **Regulations / Compliance**:  
     11. Obtain local building permits.  
     12. Secure state environmental permits for water use.  
     13. Meet federal energy‑efficiency standards (EISA).  
     14. Adhere to OSHA safety regulations for construction sites.  
     15. Comply with the Midwest regional flood‑plain regulations.  
   - **Stakeholder Expectations**:  
     16. Achieve 99.999% uptime for mission‑critical services.  
     17. Provide continuous power to critical systems with no downtime during transition.  
     18. Ensure physical security meets NIST SP 800‑53 Level 3.  
     19. Deliver a LEED‑Gold certification for sustainability.  
     20. Maintain a disaster‑recovery plan approved by senior executives.  
     21. Provide quarterly progress reports to the board.  
   - **Additional hard limits that cross categories** (counted once but noted for overlap):  
     22. Land acquisition must be finalized before month 2 (Time & Resources).  
     23. Power utility contract must be signed with a 10 MW capacity guarantee (Technology & Regulations).  
     24. Insurance coverage must be in place covering $50 million liability (Budget & Regulations).

4. **Count the constraints**  
   - We have enumerated 24 distinct hard limits (each numbered above).  
   - Every item is a definitive limit that must be met, not a risk or preference.  

5. **Conclusion**  
   - The project has **24 hard constraints** that must be identified and managed. <ANS_START>24<ANS_END>

[Question] A public health department intends to run a nationwide vaccination campaign for a new vaccine, with a total budget of $20 million, a 4‑month campaign window, and a target of vaccinating 10 million people. What constraints should they identify?
[Answer] **Reasoning Chain**

1. **Identify the explicit limits stated in the project description.**  
   - The description lists a total budget of $20 million.  
   - It specifies a 4‑month campaign window.  
   - It sets a target of vaccinating 10 million people.  
   - It refers to a new vaccine, implying that regulatory approval, cold‑chain logistics, and other compliance requirements must be met.

2. **Map each explicit limit to a constraint category.**  
   - **Budget** → “Total budget of $20 million” is a hard financial ceiling.  
   - **Time** → “4‑month campaign window” is a fixed schedule.  
   - **Resources / Scope** → “Target of vaccinating 10 million people” imposes a fixed demand on staff, equipment, and distribution channels.  
   - **Regulations / Compliance** → “New vaccine” necessitates meeting approval timelines, storage requirements, and reporting obligations, which are mandatory constraints.

3. **Check for any additional hard limits that might be implied but not explicitly listed.**  
   - No additional fixed deadlines, technology stacks, or stakeholder‑mandated deliverables are mentioned.  
   - The description does not impose a cap on personnel numbers or specify a particular technology platform, so no extra constraints emerge from those categories.

4. **Count the distinct constraint categories identified.**  
   - Budget (1)  
   - Time (2)  
   - Resources/Scope (3)  
   - Regulations/Compliance (4)  

   No other categories contain hard limits, so the total number of constraints is **four**.

**Conclusion**  
The project description implies exactly four hard, limiting constraints: Budget, Time, Resources/Scope, and Regulations/Compliance. Therefore, the correct answer is **4**. <ANS_START>4<ANS_END>
