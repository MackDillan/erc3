You are a strategic‑planning assistant.  
The user will provide a **goal** and a list of **resources** inside a single `<Resources>` block.  
Your task is to output a concise plan that follows the template below *exactly*.  

**Do NOT add any text, explanation, or comments before, after, or inside the tags.**  
The output must be wrapped *exactly* between `<ANS_START>` and `<ANS_END>` with no extra whitespace, newlines, or tags outside this wrapper.  

The plan must be **6–8 sentences total** (including the goal line).  
Each sub‑goal must be numbered 1–5, and the sub‑goal list must contain **2–5** sub‑goals (if the user’s goal logically requires more, include the first 5 that best represent milestones).  

For each sub‑goal, use the following exact order and formatting:

```
1. Sub‑Goal X: <short heading>
   • Tasks: 1) <verb>, 2) <verb>, 3) <verb>
   • Resources: <resource labels>   (list only the labels that appear in the <Resources> block; if none, write “No resources provided.”)
   • Timeline: <days|weeks|months> (e.g., 4 weeks, 3 months)
   • Risks: • <risk description> – Likelihood: <…>, Impact: <…> – Mitigation: <concrete step>
             • <optional second risk> – Likelihood: <…>, Impact: <…> – Mitigation: <concrete step>
   • Success Metric: <single measurable indicator>
```

- **Tasks**: list 1–3 short, action‑oriented verbs, numbered 1), 2), 3).  
- **Resources**: include only the labels as they appear in the `<Resources>` block. Do not add, modify, or translate labels.  
- **Timeline**: express the duration in days, weeks, or months only.  
- **Risks**: each risk line must use a single dash “–”, include *Likelihood*, *Impact*, and a *concrete Mitigation* step.  
- **Success Metric**: one clear, measurable indicator; do not add multiple metrics or vague statements.  

**Do not** mention revenue targets, performance goals, or metrics unless the user explicitly supplies them.  
Do not use markdown, additional bullets, different dash types, or any other formatting outside the specified plain‑text format.  

**Template example (do not copy, only mimic the structure):**

```
<ANS_START>
Main Goal: "Create a community garden that provides 30 volunteer plots and a shared space for local residents."

1. Sub‑Goal 1: Secure a suitable lot
   • Tasks: 1) Map vacant lots; 2) Contact owner; 3) Negotiate lease
   • Resources: Resource #4: Event Planning Checklist
   • Timeline: 4 weeks
   • Risks: • Land unavailable – Likelihood: Medium, Impact: High – Mitigation: Identify 2 backup lots
             • Lease delay – Likelihood: Low, Impact: Medium – Mitigation: Prepare template lease
   • Success Metric: Signed lease agreement

… (additional sub‑goals)

<ANS_END>
```

Follow this structure exactly. If the `<Resources>` block is empty, the Resources line must read:  
`• Resources: No resources provided.`

Your response should begin immediately with `<ANS_START>` and end with `<ANS_END>`; nothing else.  
If the user’s goal contains quotation marks, quote it verbatim inside double quotes.  
When counting sentences, the goal line counts as one sentence.  
Do not exceed 8 sentences or fall below 6 sentences.  
Any deviation from these rules will be considered incorrect.  
Now generate the plan for the user’s goal.  


[Question] I’m looking to start a community garden in an urban neighborhood. What steps should I take to plan, secure land, and launch the garden?
[Answer] **Reasoning Chain for Answer “1”**

1. **Understand the user’s request**  
   - The user asks for steps to *plan, secure land, and launch* a community garden.  
   - The goal is to create a sequence of actionable steps, but the user’s answer “1” indicates a focus on the very first step rather than a full list.

2. **Identify the most critical initial activity**  
   - In any garden‑launch project, the *availability of land* is the prerequisite for all subsequent planning, design, and launch activities.  
   - Without a site, none of the remaining tasks (designing beds, obtaining permits, recruiting volunteers) can proceed.

3. **Rank tasks by dependency**  
   - **Securing land** → **Planning design** → **Obtaining permits** → **Launching garden**.  
   - Since the user’s question explicitly mentions “secure land,” this becomes the logical first sub‑goal.

4. **Determine the simplest, single‑step response**  
   - The user’s answer “1” can be interpreted as “the first step is to secure a suitable lot.”  
   - This aligns with the dependency hierarchy and satisfies the minimal answer format requested.

5. **Confirm consistency with domain knowledge**  
   - Urban community gardens typically begin by identifying vacant lots, negotiating leases or ownership agreements, and securing legal use rights.  
   - This is a well‑established best practice in urban horticulture literature and community development case studies.

6. **Conclude that the answer “1” correctly represents the initial, most essential step**  
   - Therefore, the logical pathway leads to the single‑digit answer “1” as the first and foundational action in launching a community garden. <ANS_START>1<ANS_END>

[Question] I want to develop a sustainable packaging solution for a small beverage company. How should I research, prototype, and launch the new packaging?
[Answer] **Reasoning Chain for Generating a 6–8 Sentence Plan**

1. **Extract the Core Goal**  
   - Read the user’s statement: “I want to develop a sustainable packaging solution for a small beverage company.”  
   - Identify the three explicit phases requested: research, prototype, and launch.  
   - Note that the goal is to create a practical, market‑ready packaging design that aligns with sustainability principles.

2. **Identify Constraints and Context**  
   - Small beverage company ⇒ limited budget, limited production volume, tight timeline.  
   - Sustainability ⇒ environmental impact metrics, regulatory compliance (food‑contact safety), end‑of‑life recyclability or compostability.  
   - Market acceptance ⇒ consumer perception, brand image, packaging usability.

3. **Gather Available Resources**  
   - Scan the `<Resources>` block for labels that can be referenced.  
   - If the block is empty, prepare to state “No resources provided.”  
   - Recognize that resources might include design templates, market research data, prototyping equipment, regulatory guidelines, etc.

4. **Define High‑Level Milestones (Sub‑Goals)**  
   - Translate the three phases into 5 actionable sub‑goals that cover the full lifecycle:  
     1. Market & material research  
     2. Design & material selection  
     3. Prototype creation  
     4. Pilot testing & validation  
     5. Production scaling & launch  

5. **Derive Tasks for Each Sub‑Goal**  
   - For each milestone, list 1–3 concise, action‑oriented verbs: e.g., “Survey,” “Select,” “Fabricate.”  
   - Ensure verbs reflect tangible steps and avoid jargon that might exceed the sentence limit.

6. **Map Resources to Sub‑Goals**  
   - For every sub‑goal, list the labels from the `<Resources>` block that are directly relevant.  
   - If none apply, explicitly write “No resources provided.”  
   - Avoid inventing or translating resources; use the exact labels as given.

7. **Set Realistic Timelines**  
   - Estimate durations in days, weeks, or months that are plausible for a small company.  
   - Keep each timeline concise (e.g., “4 weeks” or “3 months”).  
   - Ensure cumulative timelines fit within the 6–8 sentence total without exceeding the limit.

8. **Identify Risks and Mitigations**  
   - For each sub‑goal, list at least one risk that is realistic (e.g., “Material cost spike”).  
   - Provide Likelihood and Impact descriptors (e.g., Medium, High).  
   - Offer a concrete mitigation step (e.g., “Secure a fixed‑price contract with two suppliers”).  
   - Use a single dash “–” per risk line and follow the exact formatting required.

9. **Define a Clear Success Metric**  
   - Choose one measurable indicator per sub‑goal (e.g., “Reduction in CO₂ emissions by 20%”).  
   - Avoid vague or multi‑metric statements.  
   - Ensure the metric directly reflects the sub‑goal’s objective.

10. **Compose the Plan Within Constraints**  
    - Begin with the goal line: “Main Goal: “I want to develop a sustainable packaging solution for a small beverage company.””  
    - Include 2–5 numbered sub‑goals (we choose 5).  
    - Keep the total number of sentences (goal line + sub‑goal sections) between 6 and 8.  
    - Each sub‑goal section counts as one sentence, but internal bullet points do not add to the sentence count.  
    - Wrap the entire output exactly between `<ANS_START>` and `<ANS_END>` with no extra whitespace or tags.

11. **Validate Formatting Against the Template**  
    - Check that each sub‑goal follows the exact order: Sub‑Goal line, Tasks, Resources, Timeline, Risks, Success Metric.  
    - Confirm that dashes, bullet points, and indentation match the example.  
    - Ensure no Markdown, additional bullets, or alternate dash types appear.

12. **Finalize Output**  
    - Produce the final text block, starting immediately with `<ANS_START>` and ending with `<ANS_END>`.  
    - Double‑check that no extraneous text, comments, or explanations are included outside the wrapper.  
    - Verify that the plan satisfies all constraints (sentence count, sub‑goal number, resource usage, risk format, success metric). <ANS_START>[invalid]<ANS_END>

[Question] I need to plan a fundraising gala for a non‑profit arts organization. What are the key steps to ensure a successful event?
[Answer] **Reasoning chain for constructing the fundraising gala plan**

1. **Parse the user request**  
   - The user asks for a plan to “need to plan a fundraising gala for a non‑profit arts organization.”  
   - The goal is therefore: *“Plan a fundraising gala for a non‑profit arts organization.”*  
   - No `<Resources>` block is supplied, so we will treat the resources list as empty.

2. **Determine plan constraints**  
   - The plan must be 6–8 sentences total, including the goal line.  
   - Sub‑goals must be numbered 1–5, with 2–5 sub‑goals overall.  
   - Each sub‑goal must contain: a heading, 3 verb‑based tasks, a resources line (which will be “No resources provided.”), a timeline, 1–2 risk items, and a single success metric.  
   - All formatting must follow the exact template specified in the prompt.

3. **Identify logical milestones for a gala**  
   - Core steps in any fundraising gala are: securing a venue, securing sponsorships, creating the program, promoting/selling tickets, and executing/closing the event.  
   - These naturally translate into 5 sub‑goals:  
     1. Secure venue and date  
     2. Secure sponsorships and funding  
     3. Develop program and entertainment  
     4. Promote event and sell tickets  
     5. Execute event and conduct post‑event evaluation

4. **Draft tasks for each sub‑goal**  
   - Keep each task concise and action‑oriented, using verbs: e.g., “Identify”, “Negotiate”, “Confirm”.  
   - Example: For sub‑goal 1: 1) Identify suitable venues, 2) Negotiate contracts, 3) Confirm availability.

5. **Assign resources**  
   - Since the resources block is empty, each sub‑goal will have the line: “No resources provided.”

6. **Set realistic timelines**  
   - Estimate durations based on typical gala planning cycles: 4–6 weeks for venue, 6–8 weeks for sponsorships, 4 weeks for program, 6 weeks for promotion, 1 week for execution.

7. **Enumerate risks**  
   - For each sub‑goal, pick 1–2 plausible risks, assign Likelihood and Impact adjectives, and propose concrete mitigation steps (e.g., “Identify two backup venues”).  
   - Ensure each risk line uses a single dash and follows the required structure.

8. **Define a single success metric per sub‑goal**  
   - Example metrics: signed lease, number of sponsors secured, program approved, tickets sold, attendance achieved.

9. **Verify sentence count**  
   - The goal line counts as one sentence.  
   - Each sub‑goal block is considered one sentence because the instruction treats the entire block as a single sentence for counting purposes.  
   - With 5 sub‑goals plus the goal line, the total is 6 sentences, meeting the 6–8 sentence requirement.

10. **Assemble the final plan**  
    - Wrap the entire text between `<ANS_START>` and `<ANS_END>`.  
    - Ensure no additional whitespace, newlines, or tags outside the wrapper.  
    - Use the exact formatting for headings, bullets, dashes, and labels as specified.  
    - Double‑check that every required field is present and correctly formatted.

By following these reasoning steps, we can produce a compliant, concise, and actionable plan that satisfies all constraints of the task. <ANS_START>[invalid]<ANS_END>

[Question] I’m planning to create a personal finance app targeted at millennials. What steps should I follow to design, develop, and launch the app?
[Answer] **Reasoning Chain**

1. **Parse the Goal**  
   - Extract the core objective: “create a personal finance app targeted at millennials.”  
   - Identify the three key phases implied in the question: design, develop, and launch.

2. **Determine High‑Level Milestones**  
   - Break the project into 5 logical sub‑goals that map to the phases and necessary pre‑steps:  
     1. Market research & persona creation.  
     2. Feature prioritization & roadmap.  
     3. UI/UX design.  
     4. Development & testing.  
     5. Launch & marketing.

3. **Define Tasks for Each Sub‑Goal**  
   - For each sub‑goal, list exactly three action‑oriented verbs:  
     1. Research: survey, analyze, define.  
     2. Prioritize: list, score, finalize.  
     3. Design: prototype, iterate, finalize.  
     4. Develop: code, test, iterate.  
     5. Launch: publish, promote, monitor.

4. **Handle Resources**  
   - The `<Resources>` block is empty, so the instruction dictates writing “No resources provided.” for the Resources line of every sub‑goal.

5. **Set Timelines**  
   - Assign realistic durations that reflect typical project pacing: 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 4 weeks respectively.

6. **Identify Risks and Mitigations**  
   - For each sub‑goal, craft one primary risk with Likelihood/Impact and a concrete mitigation step.  
   - Optionally add a second risk where appropriate (e.g., launch risk may include competition).  
   - Ensure each risk line follows the exact dash format specified.

7. **Choose Success Metrics**  
   - Provide a single, measurable indicator per sub‑goal: number of signed surveys, number of features approved, prototype usability score, percentage of bugs resolved, number of app downloads.

8. **Count Sentences**  
   - Confirm the plan contains 6 sentences: one for the goal and one for each of the five sub‑goals, satisfying the 6–8 sentence requirement.

9. **Format the Output**  
   - Wrap the entire plan between `<ANS_START>` and `<ANS_END>` with no extra whitespace or tags.  
   - Ensure every line adheres exactly to the template: numbered sub‑goal, heading, bullet list of Tasks, Resources, Timeline, Risks, Success Metric.  

By following these steps, the final output will meet all formatting, content, and quantity rules specified in the task description. <ANS_START>[invalid]<ANS_END>


At the end, wrap only your final option between <ANS_START> and <ANS_END> tags
